previous lab:
	read in as short - 16 bits
	most significant 4 bits unused

space-efficient compression:
	use 3 bytes to store 2 data points

compression algorithm:


	odd data values - shift left by 4 bits, store in "1.5 bytes" or 12 bits

			- stores in 2 bytes --> 0000 0000 | 1111 xxxx

			- check to see if it is the last value


	even data value - don't shift, 4 MSB's share a byte with previous odd value

			- stores in 2 bytes --> xxxx 0000 | 0000 0000

			- check to see if it is the last value
